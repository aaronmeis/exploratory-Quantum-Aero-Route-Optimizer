# NotebookLM Guidance: Quantum Route Optimization

## Suggested NotebookLM Items
1.  **Briefing Note**: A policy-level overview of how quantum-inspired solvers can secure defense logistics.
2.  **Deep Dive Podcast**: A conversational analysis of QAOA and D-Wave heuristics versus classical greedy algorithms.
3.  **Concept Map**: Visualizing the "Superposition of Paths" and gravity vector constraints.

## Suggested Prompt
"Compare and contrast classical TSP solvers with the D-Wave quantum annealing approach described in these docs. Specifically, highlight how 'gravity vectors' are modeled as constraints and provide a summary of the 18% fuel saving case study in defense logistics."

## Infographics

### Standard Infographic Prompt
"Create an infographic showing the 'Quantum Leap in Logistics'. Visualize a vehicle routing problem being solved by classical vs quantum-inspired methods. Highlight the 18% fuel savings achieved in the defense logistics case study."

### Detailed Infographic Prompt
"Generate a technical infographic on 'Quantum-Inspired Heuristics for Aerospace'. Include a component diagram showing the D-Wave Ocean/Qiskit integration, a visualization of 'Superposition of Paths', and a table comparing classical heuristics to QAOA-style solvers for vehicle routing with time windows."

## Gemini Canvas Visual Prompt
"Build a 3D interactive routing map for 'Global Aerospace Logistics'. Visualize flight paths as arcing neon lines that shift in real-time based on simulated geopolitical disruptions. Include a quantum-inspired 'Superposition View' where multiple potential paths exist simultaneously as translucent overlays until the 'optimization' button is clicked, resolving to the fuel-optimized route (18% savings)."

## Theme
**Quantum Superposition**: Deep space purple and neon cyan. Visualizing multi-dimensional paths and probabilistic futures.
