# Quantum Aero Route Optimizer

> [!NOTE]
> This is for exploratory learning and understanding and knowledge development with mockup data from Kaggle and NASA.

**Type**: Graph solver with D-Wave sims

**Description**: Simulate quantum annealing (via D-Wave Ocean or qiskit) for optimizing shipment routes in global aerospace supply chains—handling disruptions from geopolitics or weather, inspired by Starship's point-to-point potential.

**First Principles**: Distance ain't linear; it's fuel, wind, gravity vectors. Superposition means all paths exist till measured—model that raw.

**Approach**: Compare classical vs quantum-inspired solvers on vehicle routing problems with time windows. Show how it could slash fuel costs in airlift or satellite delivery.

**Impact Context**: From recent reports, quantum helps real-time routing in defense logistics—eighteen percent fuel savings.

## Overview
This repository explores the intersection of classical mechanics (gravity-based path optimization) and quantum computing (annealing for TSP/routing).

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Explore D-Wave annealing samples in `notebooks/`.
3. Check [data_links.md](docs/data_links.md) for network graph datasets.
